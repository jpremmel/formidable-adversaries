## Description

_In this game, the user gets to choose a fighter from a list of powerful fictional creatures. The computer randomly selects an opponent. During the fight, the user is given three attack options. After selecting their attack, the user waits briefly while the computer chooses an attack, and the turns continue to alternate. Each character begins with 50 health points which are depleted when receiving attacks. The first fighter to reach a health level of zero loses the fight. This is our first team project as Epicodus students._
